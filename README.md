# Simulation-of-the-dynamics-of-a-hydraulic-actuator-using-Simulink
Simulation of the dynamics of a hydraulic actuator connected to an inertial load of mass, M = 1000Kg with both the inlet and outlet ports of the cylinder in closed condition. Both the chambers of the cylinder are having trapped hydraulic fluid pressurized to an initial value of Po.
